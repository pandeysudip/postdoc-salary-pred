We have identified a Mesorhizobium genomic island associated with nickel tolerance in generalist lineages that grow on and off nickel-enriched serpentine soil (Porter et al. 2017 ISME), and have expanded this project to encompass ~700 strains. The system has multiple specialist and generalist clades and is poised to address questions about the ecological and genomic determinants of adaptation in wild microbes. This NSF project also includes Joel Griffitts (Brigham Young University) who is testing the molecular genetic basis of nickel tolerance.

Our ideal candidate would have a strong quantitative background, firm understanding of evolutionary ecology, excellent written and verbal communication skills, and ability to work well in a collaborative team. Training in at least one of genomics, bioinformatics, phylogenetic methods, and/or biostatistics is desirable. The position will be based in Pullman WA and the successful applicant will have access to the excellent facilities at WSU for plant growth, phenomics, genomics, biochemistry, and microscopy. There is a strong intellectual community in the Palouse spanning WSU and our neighbor 7 miles to the east, the University of Idaho in Moscow, ID. Pullman and Moscow are vibrant small towns with a strong sense of community and ready access to outdoor activities. The postdoc will have regular virtual meetings with co-advisor, Dr. Porter, and will visit collaborators at the Vancouver campus twice a year.

About City of Hope
City of Hope, an innovative biomedical research, treatment and educational institution with over 6,000 employees, is dedicated to the prevention and cure of cancer and other life-threatening diseases and guided by a compassionate, patient-centered philosophy.

Founded in 1913 and headquartered in Duarte, California, City of Hope is a remarkable non-profit institution, where compassion and advanced care go hand-in-hand with excellence in clinical and scientific research. City of Hope is a National Cancer Institute designated Comprehensive Cancer Center and a founding member of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, an alliance of the nations leading cancer centers that develops and institutes standards of care for cancer treatment.

Position Summary
Funded by the National Cancer Institute (T32CA221709), the program at City of Hope provides exceptionally motivated postdoctoral fellows with scientific knowledge, research training and professional skills in the rapidly growing and interconnected fields of cancer metabolism. The goal of the program is to provide innovative curriculum and mentored research that prepares an elite group of highly motivated fellows to become successful, independent researchers in cancer biology. This Fellow will be mentored by Dr. Jiang, performing cancer-focused, funded, high-impact research in cancer metabolism, and who has a history of mentoring postdoctoral fellows. Required coursework includes a class in Cancer Metabolism. In addition, trainees will participate in journal clubs, data clubs, professional development seminars, monthly luncheons with mentors, national and international scientific conferences, and a yearly Cancer Metabolism Day.

U.S. citizenship or U.S. permanent resident status is required. Individuals from underrepresented minority groups are strongly encouraged to apply.

Fellowships are for up to three years with an institute-supplemented stipend ($61,921 per year plus a full benefit package) and $5,000 for research supplies.

Dr. Jiangs previous study identified a novel NADPH shuttle system supporting ROS defense in the anchorage independent cancer cells (Jiang L, et al. Nature, 2016). The mass spec based stable isotope (NOT radioactive) tracing has been a great tool in the cancer metabolism field, with the advantage of directly studying metabolism in patients (Hensley CT, et al. Cell, 2016). These studies provided additional knowledge to the well-known Warburg Effect. In addition to generate ATP for energy requirement, metabolism also provides building blocks and controls stress defense. Not only glycolysis, TCA cycle, amino acid and nuclide acid metabolism are all very active in both cultured cancer cells and patient tumors.

Dr. Jiangs lab focuses on the molecular mechanisms regulating central carbon metabolism (citrate) and signaling amino acid (serine) during the development and progress of metabolic diseases. The application of mathematical bioengineering based modeling prediction and experimental mass spec based metabolic tracing will provide a better understanding of the metabolic rewiring in diabetes, cancer and other diseases.

A motivated postdoc is encouraged to join Dr. Jiangs laboratory, a new addition to the Diabetes & Metabolism Research Institute, headed by Arthur D. Riggs, Ph.D., a pioneer in the field renowned for his work on synthesizing the first man-made gene and using synthetic genes to produce human insulin.

Qualifications

Postdoctoral Research Fellow,$34K-$57K (Glassdoor est.),"We are looking for a postdoctoral fellow to join Prof. Lawrence Wald’s group at the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging. The successful candidate will work on a recent technology development in our lab, namely the design of gradient coils for MRI with explicit constraints for peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS). PNS is a major limitation of gradient switching speed in MRI and therefore represents a limit of spatial resolution, imaging speed and distortion levels for many imaging sequences. We have developed the first eversimulation framework that is capable of predicting PNS thresholds for arbitrary gradient coil windings within 5%, see the following publications for more details:

· Klein V, Davids M, Wald LL, Schad LR and Guerin B (2018), “Sensitivity analysis of neurodynamic and electromagnetic simulation parameters for robust prediction of Peripheral Nerve Stimulation, Physics in Medicine and Biology, DOI: 10.1088/1361-6560/aaf308

· Davids M, Guerin B, Vom Endt A, Schad LR, Wald LL (2019), “Prediction of peripheral nerve stimulation thresholds of MRI gradient coils using coupled electromagnetic and neurodynamic simulations”, Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, 81(1):686-701

· Mathias Davids, Bastien Guérin, Matthias Malzacher, Lothar R. Schad & Lawrence L. Wald (2017). ""Predicting Magnetostimulation Thresholds in the Peripheral Nervous System using Realistic Body Models"". Scientific Reports 7: 5316

Based on this work, we are now starting a program of gradient coil design and optimization with explicit constraints for PNS. In other words, we propose for the first time to design (numerical optimization) and construct (RF and mechanical engineering) gradient coils with intrinsically greater PNS thresholds compared to existing devices. We expect this work to have a major impact on MRI imagine speed and resolution for many imaging in tasks.

The successful candidate will be responsible for driving this project. He/she will join a team of experts in RF engineering and numerical/modeling and will receive mentoring by Prof. Lawrence Wald and Prof. Bastien Guerin in order to ensure good progression of the work. Our lab environment is ideal for training, mentoring and exploring other different research avenues, and thus this experience should be very enriching from a scientific and personal perspective.

Only candidates of the highest scientific background and with excellent communication skills will be considered. A high emphasis will be placed on independence, motivation and creativity (ability to come up with own ideas and pursue them independently) during the interview process. A Ph.D. degree in biomedical engineering, electrical engineering, physics or comparable from a major institution is required. A strong command of calculus, linear algebra and programming in at least one language (Matlab, Python, C etc…) are essential. The ideal candidate will also be hands on with a taste for building rigs and tinkering with electronics. Specific expertise in MR imaging is not required, but the successful candidate should obviously have an interest in learning biomedical imaging.

Post Doc Fellow Radiation Oncology,$38K-$59K (Glassdoor est.),"Postdoctoral Position in
Genome Stability

Thousands of DNA lesions
arise in each cell of the human body on a daily basis. Many of these lesions
arise from errors in DNA synthesis, which requires accurate replication of
billions of DNA base pairs every day. The DNA damage response functions to
repair these lesions, protect against replication fork collapse, and promote
genomic stability. Defects in the response can lead to cancer, developmental
abnormalitites, and premature aging.

The Elia lab is dedicated to
elucidating cellular mechanisms that maintain genomic stability after DNA
damage to prevent the development of cancer and genetic disorders (Elia et al
Mol Cell 60:280; Elia, Mol Cell 59:867; Emmanuele, Elia, Cell 147:459). Current
projects in the lab focus on factors that regulate the repair of stalled
replication forks and/or function in ubiquitin-dependent signaling. Among such
factors is the ubiquitin ligase RFWD3, whose mutation causes the cancer
predisposition syndrome Fanconi Anemia. Other projects include elucidating
pathways involved in DNA damage modulation of immune signaling, and developing
cancer therapeutics targeting the DNA damage response.

We use a multi-disciplinary
approach including cell biology, biochemistry, mass spectrometry proteomics,
and functional genomics. The lab is part of the Center for Cancer Research at
Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Harvard and is affiliated with the
Broad Institute of MIT. It belongs to a vibrant DNA damage community at MGH and
interacts closely with the lab of Lee Zou.

Dr. Bussard, an NIH funded investigator, is looking for a highly motivated post-doctoral fellow interested in breast cancer bone biology and the tumor microenvironment. The laboratory utilizes murine models of metastasis, primary cell culture, molecular biology techniques, high-end fluorescence microscopy, 3-D models, exosomal analysis, and patient samples to answer questions related to disseminated breast tumor cells and breast cancer cell quiescence in the bone microenvironment.

Recent work in the laboratory has identified candidate cellular and exosomal microRNAs that impact breast cancer cell dormancy in the bone.

JOB SUMMARY:

Postdoctoral Research Position to Study Public Understanding of Genetics/Genomics

Professors Michelle Meyer and Christopher Chabris are seeking an outstanding researcher for a position as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Geisinger Health System. The position is fully funded by a three-year grant to Professor Meyer to investigate the ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) of social/behavioral genetics as well as certain kinds of clinical genetic information (i.e., polygenic scores). ELSI research should be understood broadly. Within the context of the grant, it includes (but is not limited to): how people understand genetic information, especially personalized information; how they view themselves, others, or human traits, behaviors and outcomes in light of this information; how they behave in response to this information; and how people understand and respond to scientific knowledge about the relationships between genes, behavior, health, and disease.

The postdoc will primarily carry out collaborative behavioral science research aimed at investigating these and related questions and will be encouraged to propose studies within the broad scope of the grant. The postdoc will report to Professors Meyer and Chabris. They will join the interdisciplinary Meyer-Chabris Lab and the broader growing community of social scientists at Geisinger (e.g., its Behavioral Insights Team). They will collaborate with other researchers across disciplines inside and outside of Geisinger, and will be based in either Lewisburg or Danville, Pennsylvania (with remote work a possibility for exceptional candidates). The postdoc will assist in planning and carrying out web-based surveys, field studies, and archival research, and in analyzing general patterns of responses as well as individual differences. They will be expected to employ a combination of approaches, from the identification and analysis of existing real-world data sets, to the design and analysis of field or lab intervention studies. We are particularly interested in candidates with strong statistical and/or computational skills. Other duties include contribution to ongoing research projects, preparation of talks and participation in seminars, and drafting reports, grant applications, and papers for publication. There will also be opportunities to collaborate on relevant bioethics, law, and policy articles.

Postdoctoral Research Fellow,$38K-$59K (Glassdoor est.),"The University of Oklahoma’s Center for Applied Social Research (CASR) seeks to hire one postdoctoral researcher to work with scientists from CASR and the University of Oklahoma’s Center for Analysis and Prediction of Storms (CAPS), and other groups in the National Weather Center (including the Storm Prediction Center) for a three-year position beginning September 2019 (start date negotiable). This position will be funded through a grant from the NOAA High Impacts Weather Testbeds Program. The research falls under the FACETs paradigm, Forecasting a Continuum of Environmental Threats, and tests next-generation approaches to integrating some of the newest meteorological innovations with a deeper understanding of societal needs and vulnerabilities. This particular work tests operational forecasters’ use of two types of experimental information in providing emergency managers with forecasts and other decision support prior to and during severe weather. The first type of experimental data is the Storm Prediction Center’s experimental temporal disaggregation of their Day 1 Outlook risk areas and their identification of corridors of enhanced threats within Day 1 Outlook areas. The second experimental information is the PIs’ Brief Vulnerability Overview Tool, which is designed to enhance forecasters’ awareness of vulnerabilities within their County Warning Area.

This project thus bridges social science, operational and experimental meteorology, and human dimensions research by creating intense and accurate simulations of National Weather Service Weather Forecasting Office operations in testbed settings in both traditional laboratory contexts (i.e., at the National Weather Center’s Hazardous Weather Testbed in Norman, OK) as well as in more “naturalistic,” in situcontexts (i.e., in National Weather Service Weather Forecasting Offices around the country). The Postdoc will be responsible for overseeing the technical aspects of study experiments, including managing the software tools that enable the “canned” scenarios. They will act as the technical link between the SPC, NWS FOs, and the PI/co-PI, and thus will develop research skills that bridge meteorology, social science, and human factors. They will assist in developing research protocols and conducting fieldwork, thereby building a set of skills and networks to leverage into future professional advancement.

Applicants should include a current C.V. and a Letter of Interest in the application.

Required Education: The postdoctoral researcher must have completed their Ph.D. by or within 30 days of the start of employment. ABD applicants must include their timeline for completing their Ph.D. in their Letter of Interest.

Skills:
Proficiency in Linux
Experience in manipulating, storing, and archiving large weather data files
Proficiency with html
Must have experience with and/or interest in conducting research at the intersection of research-to-operations

Postdoctoral Research Associate,$38K-$59K (Glassdoor est.),"The Partnerships for Native Health at Washington State University is seeking applications for a Postdoctoral Research Associate in health economics. The Partnership for Native Health is a program within the Institute for Research and Education to Advance Community Health (IREACH), a team of about 70 faculty and staff engaged in conducting community-centered, multidisciplinary research, training and education, and outreach with underserved populations. Partnerships for Native Health is a unit under the IREACH umbrella that focuses on improving the health and quality of life of American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander populations. Research includes both observational and behavioral intervention studies, many of which involve randomized controlled effectiveness trials. Health economics questions relevant to sustainability and short- and long-term impact of interventions are of great interest to research funders and our community research partners. The position can be located in either Seattle or Pullman, Washington.

This is a temporarily funded, one (1) year postdoctoral fellowship with subsequent renewals subject to satisfactory performance, mutual consent, and available funding.

The appointment is in IREACH, with an academic appointment with the School of Economic Sciences at Washington State University. The position emphasizes health economics and empirical analyses of both randomized control trials and observational data.

The successful applicant will work with IREACH faculty, including a senior health economist, physicians, epidemiologists, psychologists, and biostatisticians, on the analysis of randomized controlled trials, all with American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander communities. IREACH supports a Research Methods Core, a collegial group of quantitative methodologists from various disciplines that are responsible for study design and quantitative research support for studies led by IREACH and other Washington State University investigators; the postdoctoral fellow will be a member of this group.

Current research with a priori specified health economics aims includes an NIH-funded Center with three multilevel behavioral intervention trials for improving blood pressure control in people with hypertension: a community-based intervention to increase the availability of healthy foods (American Indians); a provider- and patient-based intervention using home blood pressure monitoring and targeted physician alerts in a healthcare organization (Alaska Natives); and a peer-facilitated educational intervention that emphasizes low salt, healthy diets based on traditional foods (Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders). Another NIH-funded Center comprises three trials of behavioral interventions to reduce alcohol-related morbidity and mortality in American Indian and Alaska Native people: an intervention to prevent alcohol-exposed pregnancies among women of child-bearing age engaged in risky drinking behaviors; an intervention that incorporates a traditional cultural practice for reducing alcohol use among for individuals with alcohol use disorders; and an intervention to facilitate the transition from alcohol detoxification to appropriate outpatient treatment programs.

In addition to the IREACH methods core, the postdoctoral fellow will integrate into the Research Methods Cores for both of these NIH Centers, and will attend weekly meetings with a team of epidemiologists, biostatisticians, and other specialists to coordinate all aspects of providing quantitative research methods support to the Center projects. The final trial evaluates a system and behavioral intervention to prevent suicide by enhancing social connectedness among urban American Indian and Alaska Native young adults. IREACH is involved with numerous other research studies with potential for health economics science, and the postdoc will receive mentoring and support in grant writing and other activities necessary to obtain funding for additional projects based on their interests and professional goals. The postdoc will be assigned other duties related to Native Health as appropriate.

In addition, Partnerships for Native Health is involved in analyzing observational data collected by the Indian Health Service at 15 care-delivery sites from across the continental United States and Alaska. Initially, the analyses will examine diagnosis, treatment, and service utilization of patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. We expect to expand the analysis of this data to other health conditions. The fellow also will be expected to participate in efforts to acquire additional funding through competitive grant applications.

The postdoctoral fellow will be directly supervised and mentored by a senior health economist in the School of Economic Sciences and by the director of the Partnerships for Native Health. Additional support and mentoring will come from faculty in other disciplines, as appropriate and needed.

"Postdoctoral Research Fellow - Human Genetics, McCarthy Lab",$38K-$59K (Glassdoor est.),"The Position


The McCarthy postdoc group at SSF will focus on developing and implementing analytical and experimental strategies that maximize the value of human genetics for drug discovery and precision medicine. The research will build upon work undertaken in Dr McCarthys academic research program at Oxford and ongoing developments at Genentech. One major area of research interest will continue to revolve around the prioritization and functional characterization of therapeutic targets -- for example, through implementing strategies for connecting regulatory variants to their downstream targets, and the high throughput perturbation of those targets in suitable cellular systems. A second strand involves the integration of high dimensional omic data (in particular proteomics) with clinical and genetic data to provide mechanistic insights into disease biology, and to identify therapeutic targets and biomarkers. The group will continue to develop and apply these approaches in the area of metabolic disease (building on existing collaborations) but will aim to implement the approaches and strategies developed across the wider range of diseases of interest to Genentech.

The successful candidate will have a PhD and/or MD from a highly reputable institution, with training in either the life sciences (biology, medicine etc) or computational sciences (maths, physics, computational science, bioinformatics etc) with proficiency and experience that spans both. They will have direct experience in applying computational and statistical approaches to high dimensional genetic and genomic data.

As well as a strong publication record, they will have excellent communication skills, and interest in exploiting the potential of human genetics to gain fundamental insights into the biology of disease. Postdocs in our lab work in a challenging and stimulating yet supportive and interactive environment, becoming independent scientists with the ability to lead their own research groups.

Dr. Jiangs previous study identified a novel NADPH shuttle system supporting ROS defense in the anchorage independent cancer cells (Jiang L, et al. Nature, 2016). The mass spec based stable isotope (NOT radioactive) tracing has been a great tool in the cancer metabolism field, with the advantage of directly studying metabolism in patients (Hensley CT, et al. Cell, 2016). These studies provided additional knowledge to the well-known Warburg Effect. In addition to generate ATP for energy requirement, metabolism also provides building blocks and controls stress defense. Not only glycolysis, TCA cycle, amino acid and nuclide acid metabolism are all very active in both cultured cancer cells and patient tumors.

Dr. Jiangs lab focuses on the molecular mechanisms regulating central carbon metabolism (citrate) and signaling amino acid (serine) during the development and progress of metabolic diseases. The application of mathematical bioengineering based modeling prediction and experimental mass spec based metabolic tracing will provide a better understanding of the metabolic rewiring in diabetes, cancer and other diseases.

A motivated postdoc is encouraged to join Dr. Jiangs laboratory, a new addition to the Diabetes & Metabolism Research Institute, headed by Arthur D. Riggs, Ph.D., a pioneer in the field renowned for his work on synthesizing the first man-made gene and using synthetic genes to produce human insulin.

Postdoctoral Fellow in Bioinformatics

Campus:

Region:
Piedmont/Triangle

Job Summary:
""A Postdoctoral Fellow (""""postdoc"""") is a professional apprenticeship designed to provide recent Ph.D. recipients with an opportunity to develop further the research skills acquired in their doctoral programs or to learn new research techniques, in preparation for an academic or research career. In the process of further developing their own research skills, it is expected that Postdoctoral Fellows will also play a significant role in the performance of research at the University and augment the role of graduate faculty in providing research instruction to graduate students. A Postdoctoral Fellow works under the supervision of a regular faculty member, who serves as a mentor to the Fellow, and it is expected that the faculty mentor will impart the realities, and variety, of scientific careers, and will encourage experiences outside the laboratory to broaden postdocs' aspirations. Within the confines of the particular research focus assigned by that faculty member, the Postdoctoral Fellow functions with a considerable degree of independence and has the freedom (and is expected) to publish the results of his or her research or scholarship during the period of appointment. Thus, the role of Postdoctoral Fellows is clearly differentiated from full-time technical employees. Postdoc appointments are characterized by all of the following conditions: * the appointee was recently (within the last two years) awarded a Ph.D. * the appointment is temporary; * the appointment involves substantially full-time research or scholarship; * the appointment is viewed as preparatory for a full-time academic and/or research career; * the appointee works under the supervision of a faculty member; and * the appointee is expected to publish the results of his or her research or scholarship during the period of appointment. As an EOE/AA employer and an ADVANCE Institution that strives to create an academic climate in which the dignity of all individuals is respected and maintained, the University of North Carolina at Charlotte encourages applications from all underrepresented groups.

Postdoctoral Research Associate (Evolutionary Genetics),$36K-$50K (Glassdoor est.),"The Rohner Lab at the Stowers Institute for Medical Research has an opening for a Postdoctoral Researcher to develop an independent project investigating the molecular, genetic, or developmental mechanisms of how cavefish thrive under extreme metabolic conditions. The lab has previously found that the cavefish Astyanax mexicanus develop high-blood sugar and insulin resistance as part of their natural strategy to survive in the caves but without the usually associated health problems (Riddle et al. Nature. 2018 Mar 29;555(7698):647-651). Furthermore, we recently found that cavefish are resilient to developing inflammation in adipose tissue due to a switch from innate to adaptive immunity (Peuss et al. Nature Ecology & Evolution 2020 Jul 20). Visit http://research.stowers.org/rohnerlab/ for more information.

The selected candidate will investigate the molecular mechanism underlying these or other impressive adaptations. The candidate will closely work with the core facilities at the institute to perform single-cell RNA sequencing, proteomics, and functional validation in vitro and in vivo. A computational/bioinformatic focus is also possible. The candidate will receive strong support from the core facilities that provide advice, training and service to enhance the Institute’s interdisciplinary and collaborative research programs. Current core facilities are staffed by over 100 scientists with expertise in bioinformatics, cytometry, histology, imaging, microarray, next generation sequencing, transgenic and ES cell technologies, proteomics and molecular biology. The Stowers Institute offers a highly competitive compensation and benefits package.

The position is funded for an initial period of one year but can be renewed for up to five years in order to allow enough time to develop a research program/publication record that makes the postdoc a strong candidate for an independent position. The Rohner Lab has a strong commitment for mutual success and is dedicated to providing support for all lab members.

Minimum requirements include a doctoral degree in the life sciences, chemistry, or biomedical engineering. Experience in one or more of the following areas is desirable: molecular biology, developmental biology, genetics, genomics, evodevo, physiology.

In addition to excellent verbal and written communication skills, successful candidates must be dynamic and highly motivated, work independently and creatively, able to work in a team-oriented environment, and proficient at problem solving.

This individual will take a lead role in advancing an AHA Innovation Award-funded project that seeks to use principles of Hebbian neural plasticity to modify neural transmission in brainstem-spinal motor pathways in individuals with chronic hemiparetic stroke.The PMRF Lab conducts both animal and human-subjects neurophysiology and neurological rehabilitation research. We explore interrelationships between the neural control of movement and pain processing after stroke and SCI. This work is predicated on the notion that optimal therapies for restoring function after neurological injury must be grounded in a neuromechanistic understanding of the causes of impairment, which requires an integrative view of nervous system function and an interdisciplinary approach to research. The ultimate goal of this work is to develop therapeutic strategies that leverage the interconnectivity of spinal sensory and motor networks to drive multi-modal rehabilitation. We are particularly interested in strategies that facilitate and direct the intrinsic ability of the central nervous system to reorganize and repair, including strategies designed to enhance the therapeutic benefits of physical rehabilitation. The lab takes a multi-disciplinary approach to understanding these phenomena, using neural engineering techniques (e.g., recording/stimulation in the nervous system, neural-computer interfaces, signal processing), quantitative motor and sensory testing, neuropharmacology, and physical therapy.The successful candidate will join a dynamic, collaborative, and growing laboratory, and will work directly with Prof. McPherson to gain relevant technical and scientific expertise, as well as professional development mentorship. The PMRF Lab is housed within the vibrant Washington University School of Medicine, where the postdoctoral fellow will be able to interact directly with other faculty, postdocs, and students engaged in neural engineering, neurophysiology, and rehabilitation research.

To apply for this postdoctoral research opportunity, follow the directions below in “Applicant Special Instructions”.Department Name/Job LocationThis position is in the Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases. This position is for the Medical School Campus.Essential FunctionsWe are looking for enthusiastic Post-docs to study antibody-mediated immunity to influenza virus. The goal of the project is to investigate the impact of host genetic variation and prior infections on the antibody response and repertoire after influenza vaccination. The techniques for this project include single-cell sequencing, mouse genetics, and antibody-based assays, such as ELISA and virus neutralization assays.In the Boon lab at Washington University in Saint Louis, Missouri, USA, we study influenza virus and influenza pathogenesis. We want to understand how the segmented genome of the virus assembles and how this process affects the outcome of virus reassortment, and thus the generation of pandemic viruses. Our work has led to the discovery of several RNA structures in the viral genome that are necessary for inter-segment RNA interactions and genome packaging (Williams et. al, Nature Communications, 2018). Currently we are identifying and investigating these structures in avian, human and swine influenza viruses and study their role on genome reassortment. Our lab also studies viral pathogenesis with the goal to identify host factors or host proteins that exacerbate inflammation and disease after highly pathogenic influenza infection. We found that the expression of IFI35 (Gounder et. al, PLoS Pathogens, 2018) increases the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and causes additional weight loss and disease after influenza infection. Future studies aim to elucidate the intracellular mechanism by which IFI35 regulates cytokine gene expression, and dissect the role of IFI35 during other microbial pathologies.The laboratory is part of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis (https://infectiousdiseases.wustl.edu). The division is home to clinical and basic science investigators and promotes translational and clinical research. The laboratory is housed on the medical campus together with many other labs studying host-pathogen interactions. We also have access to an enhanced biosafety level 3 laboratory. The work environment is very collaborative and there are many opportunities to work with colleagues in other disciplines.

"Postdoctoral Research Fellow - Human Genetics, McCarthy Lab",$29K-$46K (Glassdoor est.),"The Position


The McCarthy postdoc group at SSF will focus on developing and implementing analytical and experimental strategies that maximize the value of human genetics for drug discovery and precision medicine. The research will build upon work undertaken in Dr McCarthys academic research program at Oxford and ongoing developments at Genentech. One major area of research interest will continue to revolve around the prioritization and functional characterization of therapeutic targets -- for example, through implementing strategies for connecting regulatory variants to their downstream targets, and the high throughput perturbation of those targets in suitable cellular systems. A second strand involves the integration of high dimensional omic data (in particular proteomics) with clinical and genetic data to provide mechanistic insights into disease biology, and to identify therapeutic targets and biomarkers. The group will continue to develop and apply these approaches in the area of metabolic disease (building on existing collaborations) but will aim to implement the approaches and strategies developed across the wider range of diseases of interest to Genentech.

The successful candidate will have a PhD and/or MD from a highly reputable institution, with training in either the life sciences (biology, medicine etc) or computational sciences (maths, physics, computational science, bioinformatics etc) with proficiency and experience that spans both. They will have direct experience in applying computational and statistical approaches to high dimensional genetic and genomic data.

As well as a strong publication record, they will have excellent communication skills, and interest in exploiting the potential of human genetics to gain fundamental insights into the biology of disease. Postdocs in our lab work in a challenging and stimulating yet supportive and interactive environment, becoming independent scientists with the ability to lead their own research groups.

NERSC provides world-class supercomputing, high performance, scalable data systems and services to 7000 users across more than 600 projects running 800 different codes. NERSC’s science impact is acknowledged by over 2000 publications per year.

The Challenge: Enabling advanced simulation and modeling at scale on energy-efficient supercomputers. In 2020, NERSC will begin deploying its first production heterogeneous CPU/GPU-based Cray supercomputer, “Perlmutter.” Perlmutter, a system optimized for science, includes future-generation AMD CPUs, next-generation NVIDIA GPUs, a high-speed interconnect, and an all-flash file system. Many codes running at NERSC must be adapted or optimized to run efficiently on GPUs, and solutions that put GPU performance in the hands of users must be portable ones. NESAP is about employing cutting-edge computational science techniques and advanced performance analysis tools to develop highly scalable, distributed parallel algorithms to meet this challenge.

Cutting-edge simulation of complex physical phenomena requires increasing amounts of computational resources due to increasing model sizes, parameter space searches, and inclusion of additional physics for higher fidelity. N4S enables simulations to make effective use of modern high-performance computing (HPC) platforms by focusing on algorithm and data structure development and implementation on new architectures such as GPUs, exposing additional parallelism and improving scalability.

As a NESAP Fellow, you will be a part of a multidisciplinary team composed of computational and domain scientists working together to transition and optimize codes to the Perlmutter system and produce mission-relevant science that pushes the limits of HPC. You will carry out code transition efforts in collaboration with a project PI and team members with the support of NERSC and vendor staff.

City of Hope is a National Cancer Institute designated Comprehensive Cancer Center and a founding member of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, an alliance of the nations leading cancer centers that develops and institutes standards of care for cancer treatment.

Position Summary
Funded by the National Cancer Institute (T32CA221709), the program at City of Hope provides exceptionally motivated postdoctoral fellows with scientific knowledge, research training and professional skills in the rapidly growing and interconnected fields of cancer metabolism. The goal of the program is to provide innovative curriculum and mentored research that prepares an elite group of highly motivated fellows to become successful, independent researchers in cancer biology. This Fellow will be mentored by Dr. Jiang, performing cancer-focused, funded, high-impact research in cancer metabolism, and who has a history of mentoring postdoctoral fellows. Required coursework includes a class in Cancer Metabolism. In addition, trainees will participate in journal clubs, data clubs, professional development seminars, monthly luncheons with mentors, national and international scientific conferences, and a yearly Cancer Metabolism Day.

U.S. citizenship or U.S. permanent resident status is required. Individuals from underrepresented minority groups are strongly encouraged to apply.

Fellowships are for up to three years with an institute-supplemented stipend ($61,921 per year plus a full benefit package) and $5,000 for research supplies.

Dr. Jiangs previous study identified a novel NADPH shuttle system supporting ROS defense in the anchorage independent cancer cells (Jiang L, et al. Nature, 2016). The mass spec based stable isotope (NOT radioactive) tracing has been a great tool in the cancer metabolism field, with the advantage of directly studying metabolism in patients (Hensley CT, et al. Cell, 2016). These studies provided additional knowledge to the well-known Warburg Effect. In addition to generate ATP for energy requirement, metabolism also provides building blocks and controls stress defense. Not only glycolysis, TCA cycle, amino acid and nuclide acid metabolism are all very active in both cultured cancer cells and patient tumors.

Dr. Jiangs lab focuses on the molecular mechanisms regulating central carbon metabolism (citrate) and signaling amino acid (serine) during the development and progress of metabolic diseases. The application of mathematical bioengineering based modeling prediction and experimental mass spec based metabolic tracing will provide a better understanding of the metabolic rewiring in diabetes, cancer and other diseases.

A motivated postdoc is encouraged to join Dr. Jiangs laboratory, a new addition to the Diabetes & Metabolism Research Institute, headed by Arthur D. Riggs, Ph.D., a pioneer in the field renowned for his work on synthesizing the first man-made gene and using synthetic genes to produce human insulin.
